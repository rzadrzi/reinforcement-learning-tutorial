# Reinforcement Learning Introduction

### Multi-arm bandit:
•	Real World -> every online Business -> Recommend System, A/B Test

### Model:
•	Reinforcement learning system model -> MDV (Markov Decision Process)

### 3 Main approaches in RL:
1.	Dynamic Programming : restrictive
2.	Monte Carlo
3.	Temporal Difference Learning (including Q-learning): least restrictive

### Supervised Learning
•	Supervised Learning algorithms into RL\
•	Differentiable models: Regression, Neural network\
•	`Neural network = Deep Reinforcement Learning (out of scope)`
